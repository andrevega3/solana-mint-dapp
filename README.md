# Solana Mint dApp (WIP)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
The goal of this application is to give developers the tooling for minting and managing tokens on Solana with it's latest updates, capabilities, and essential 3rd party tooling such as Metaplex. It is currently a work in progress. While initially this project will focus on minting fungible tokens on Solana. It will expand to be able to mint all token types on Solana

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
